      <p>SCENE.--_Antechamber of the CZAR'S private room. Large window at the
back, with drawn curtains over it.</p>

<p> _Present._--PRINCE PETROVITCH, BARON RAFF, MARQUIS DE POIVRARD, COUNT
ROUVALOFF.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6> <p class="speech"> He is beginning well, this young Czar. </p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6> <p class="speech">(_shrugs his shoulders_) All young Czars do begin well.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech">And end badly.</p> 

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">[1]MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech"> Well, I have no right to complain. He has done me one
good service, at any rate.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO">[1]PRINCE PETRO.</h6><p class="speech"> Cancelled your appointment to Archangel, I suppose?</p>

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech"> Yes; my head wouldn't have been safe there for an
hour.[1]</p> 

<p class="speech">(_Enter GENERAL KOTEMKIN._)</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> Ah! General, any more news of our romantic Emperor? </p>

<h6 class="name GENKOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h6><p class="speech"> You are quite right to call him romantic, Baron; a week ago
I found him amusing himself in a garret with a company of strolling
players; to-day his whim is all the convicts in Siberia are to be
recalled, and political prisoners, as he calls them, amnestied.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"> Political prisoners! Why, half of them are no better than
common murderers!</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> And the other half much worse?</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> Oh, you wrong them, surely, Count. Wholesale trade has
always been more respectable than retail.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> But he is really too romantic. He objected yesterday to my
having the monopoly of the salt tax. He said the people had a right to
have cheap salt.</p>

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech"> Oh, that's nothing; but he actually disapproved of a
State banquet every night because there is a famine in the Southern
provinces. (_The young CZAR enters unobserved, and overhears the rest._)</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"> Quelle b√©tise! The more starvation there is among the
people, the better. It teaches them self-denial, an excellent virtue,
Baron, an excellent virtue.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> I have often heard so; I have often heard so.</p>

<h6 class="name GENKOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h6><p class="speech"> He talked of a Parliament, too, in Russia, and said the
people should have deputies to represent them.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> As if there was not enough brawling in the streets already,
but we must give the people a room to do it in. But, Messieurs, the
worst is yet to come. He threatens a complete reform in the public
service on the ground that the people are too heavily taxed.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> He can't be serious there. What is the use of the people
except[2] to get money out of? But talking of taxes, my dear Baron, you
must really let me have forty thousand roubles to-morrow? my wife says
she must have a new diamond bracelet.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> (_aside to BARON RAFF_). Ah, to match the one Prince Paul gave
her last week, I suppose.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"> I must have sixty thousand roubles at once, Baron. My son
is overwhelmed with debts of honour which he can't pay.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> What an excellent son to imitate his father so carefully!</p>

<h6 class="name GENKOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h6><p class="speech"> You are always getting money. I never get a single kopeck I
have not got a right to. It's unbearable; it's ridiculous! My nephew is
going to be married. I must get his dowry for him.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"> My dear General, your nephew must be a perfect Turk. He
seems to get married three times a week regularly.</p>

<h6 class="name GENKOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h6><p class="speech"> Well, he wants a dowry to console him.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> I am sick of town. I want a house in the country.</p>

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech">I am sick of the country. I want a house in town.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> Mes amis, I am extremely sorry for you. It is out of the
question.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech">But my son, Baron?</p>

<h6 class="name GENKOTEMK">GEN. KOTEMK.</h6><p class="speech"> But my nephew?</p>

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech"> But my house in town?</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> But my house in the country?</p>

<h6 class="name MARKDEPOIV">MARQ. DE POIV.</h6><p class="speech">But my wife's diamond bracelet?</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech">Gentlemen, impossible! The old _regime_ in Russia is dead;
the funeral begins to-day.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> Then I shall wait for the resurrection.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"></p> Yes, but, _en attendant_, what are we to do?</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech">What have we always done in Russia when a Czar suggests
reforms?--nothing. You forget we are diplomatists. Men of thought should
have nothing to do with action. Reforms in Russia are very tragic, but
they always end in a farce.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> I wish Prince Paul were here. [3]By the bye, I think this boy
is rather ungrateful to him. If that clever old Prince had not
proclaimed him Emperor at once without giving him time to think about
it, he would have given up his crown, I believe, to the first cobbler he
met in the street.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech">But do you think, Baron, that Prince Paul is really
going?[3]</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> He is exiled.</p>

<h6 class="name PRINCEPETRO"> PRINCE PETRO. </h6><p class="speech"> Yes; but is he going?</p>
