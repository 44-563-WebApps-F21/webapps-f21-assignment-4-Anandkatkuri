        <h4>ACT IV:'Place S. Isaac' amended to _Place St. Isaac_;</h4>

        
<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> I am sure of it; at least he told me he had sent two
telegrams already to Paris about his dinner.</p>

<h6 class="name COUNTR">COUNT R. </h6><p class="speech"> Ah! that settles the matter.</p>

<h6 class="name CZAR">CZAR.</h6><p class="speech">(_coming forward_). Prince Paul better send a third telegram and
order (_counting them_) six extra places.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech">The devil!</p>

<h6 class="name CZAR">CZAR.</h6><p class="speech"> No, Baron, the Czar. Traitors! There would be no bad kings in the
world if there were no bad ministers like you. It is men such as you who
wreck mighty empires on the rock of their own greatness. Our mother,
Russia, hath no need of such unnatural sons. You can make no atonement
now; it is too late for that. The grave cannot give back your dead, nor
the gibbet your martyrs, but I shall be more merciful to you. I give you
your lives! That is the curse I would lay on you. But if there is a man
of you found in Moscow by to-morrow night your heads will be off your
shoulders.</p>

<h6 class="name BARONRAFF">BARON RAFF. </h6><p class="speech"> You remind us wonderfully, Sire, of your Imperial father.</p>
